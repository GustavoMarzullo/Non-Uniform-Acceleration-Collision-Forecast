# Non-Uniform-Acceleration-Collision-Forecast

This code works by testing if two particles are in the same hitbox at the sametime. The particle's position is calculated by solving the differential equation ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=a(t)).

Although it's written for an acceleration which is only time's dependent, it's easy to impliment for a(t,x1,x2...).
